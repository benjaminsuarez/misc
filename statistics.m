%% t-test
% The t score is a ratio between the difference between two groups and the difference within the groups.
% The larger the t score, the more difference there is between groups.
% The smaller the t score, the more similarity there is between groups.
% A t score of 3 means that the groups are three times as different from each other as they are within each other.
% When you run a t test, the bigger the t-value, the more likely it is that the results are repeatable.
% Every t-value has a p-value to go with it. A p-value is the probability that the results from your sample data occurred by chance.

%% three types:
% independant, means of two groups.
% paired sample t-test, means of same group vs. different times (eg. 1 year apart)
% one sample t-test, mean of single group vs. known mean
